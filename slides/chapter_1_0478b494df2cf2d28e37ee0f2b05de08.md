Welcome back! Sometimes, machine learning models tend to perform less well in production than during development. This can cause much disappointment, and is commonly attributed to overfitting, a topic we covered earlier. There is however another possibility: your production data might differ in subtle ways from your training data, so that the patterns your model correctly picked up are not as relevant. Let's dig deeper into this situation, and how it can be fixed.

## What is dataset shift? 

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "f487295fbe"
```

Sometimes, the relationship between $X$ and $y$ changes over **time**. 
- The presence of the keyword "Microsoft Excel" in a Curriculum Vitae has become less important as a predictor of a good applicant for a data analysis job.
- With the introduction of two-step authentication techniques, multiple password attempts are no longer a serious warning sign of a cyber attack.

In other cases, the shift is not temporal, but rather a **change of domain**: 

- An OCR (optical character recognition) software might be deployed on wrinkled, half-faded receipts, whereas it was trained on high quality scanned documents. 
- An app that predicts imminent heart attack was trained only on elderly males.

## Examples of dataset shift

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "d642d47619"
```

`@part1`
- A bank built a classifier that predicts whether a customer will default on their loan given their homeownership status at the time of the application.
- The model was built using data from 2008. In that period, most good risk
