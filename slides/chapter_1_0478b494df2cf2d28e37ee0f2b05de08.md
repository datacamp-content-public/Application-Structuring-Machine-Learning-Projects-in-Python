Hi, and welcome back. We saw in previous lectures that in order to deploy a machine learning model, we need to split our data into training and test. That split is usually performed using random sampling, to ensure that both datasets represent the same process - or, put more formally, come from the same distribution. Similarly, we have assumed that production, or "live" data, also come from that same data-generating process. This means that any patterns we detect in our training set, and validate using our test set, will continue to be useful when the model is deployed. In this section, we will be a bit more honest about how the real world looks like: it turns out that, often, production data can come from a different distribution than training and test data. Luckily, there are many techniques we can use to overcome this challenge.
